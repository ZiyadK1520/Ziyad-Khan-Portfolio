                Driven by a passion for growth and efficiency, I continuously strive to refine my skills, adapt quickly, and make impactful contributions. 
                I’m a second-year student at Ontario Tech University, pursuing a degree in Networking and IT Security, based in <span class="highlight">Toronto, Canada</span>. 
                My experience spans both technical and customer-facing roles, where I’ve developed a solid foundation in <span class="highlight">HTML,</span> <span class="highlight">CSS,</span> <span class="highlight">and Javascript,</span> and I'm eager to expand my expertise
                 in these areas while picking up new skills along the way. With a strong focus on problem-solving and hands-on learning, 
                 I’m excited to bring my technical knowledge, leadership, and enthusiasm into the field of tech.
                Aside from tech, here are some of my other hobbies!
                <ul id="list">
                    <li>Working Out</li>
                    <li>Building Computers</li>

            <p>I’m <span>Ziyad Khan</span>, a second-year student at Ontario Tech University, pursuing a degree in Networking and IT Security.
                 I’m passionate about technology, particularly in how it can be used to solve real-world problems and am excited to be a part of the evolution/development of the field.
                  With experience in both technical and customer-facing roles, I’ve honed my skills in programming, troubleshooting, and leadership. 
                  I’m eager to further develop these abilities through an internship or co-op position, where I can gain practical experience and contribute meaningfully to a team in the 
                  tech field.
