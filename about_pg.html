        <div id="about_me">
            <p>I’m Ziyad Khan, a second-year student at Ontario Tech University, pursuing a degree in Networking and IT Security.
                 I’m passionate about technology, particularly in how it can be used to solve real-world problems and am excited to be a part of the evolution/development of the field.
                  With experience in both technical and customer-facing roles, I’ve honed my skills in programming, troubleshooting, and leadership. 
                  I’m eager to further develop these abilities through an internship or co-op position, where I can gain practical experience and contribute meaningfully to a team in the 
                  tech field.
                Aside from coding, here are some of my other hobbies!</p>
